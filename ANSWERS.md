# Assessment Answers

## 1. What are the top 5 performance/UX issues you anticipate when dealing with large tabular data?

1. **Rendering Performance**: Large datasets (10,000+ rows) can cause significant rendering delays and UI freezing. Virtual scrolling or pagination is essential.

2. **Memory Consumption**: Loading all data into memory at once can cause browser crashes. Implementing data virtualization or server-side pagination is crucial.

3. **Search and Filter Performance**: Real-time filtering across large datasets can be slow. Debounced search and indexed filtering are necessary.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tables with many columns become unusable on mobile devices. Responsive design with horizontal scrolling or card layouts is required.

5. **Network Bandwidth**: Loading large datasets over slow connections can be problematic. Implementing progressive loading and data compression helps.

## 2. How does your code ensure responsiveness and accessibility?

**Responsiveness:**
- Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
- Horizontal scrolling for tables on small screens
- Collapsible action menus on mobile devices
- Flexible filter layouts that stack on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing

**Accessibility:**
- Proper ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all components
- High contrast color schemes for status indicators
- Screen reader friendly table structure
- Focus management in modals and dropdowns
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

## 3. If you could add one feature to improve vendor management, what would it be and why?

**Real-time Collaboration Dashboard** - A feature that allows multiple users to view and manage vendors simultaneously with live updates. This would include:

- Real-time status indicators showing who is editing which vendor
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Activity feed showing recent changes
- Comment system for vendor records
- Audit trail for compliance

This feature would significantly improve team productivity and reduce data conflicts in enterprise environments where multiple procurement teams work together.

## 4. How did you use any AI tool (if applicable)? What guidance did it provide?

I used AI assistance for:
- Code structure optimization and best practices
- UI/UX design patterns for enterprise applications
- Performance optimization techniques for large datasets
- Accessibility guidelines implementation
- Responsive design strategies

The AI provided guidance on modern React patterns, component architecture, and helped identify potential performance bottlenecks in the initial implementation.
