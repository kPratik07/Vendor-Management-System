# AI_USAGE.md

This project used AI (ChatGPT) to assist with:

1. **Planning project structure and folders** based on real-world React best practices.
2. **Generating dummy data** for 100+ vendors to simulate enterprise-scale performance.
3. **Creating modular components** (filters, modal, pagination, etc.) using Tailwind and ShadCN UI.
4. **Writing and validating form logic** with clear separation of concerns.

All AI-generated code was verified and adjusted manually for accuracy, readability, and performance.
